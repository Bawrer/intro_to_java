# intro_to_java
## week 1 day 1
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

## Advantages of Java:
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Java is a pure object-oriented programming language, which promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

2. Strong Community Support: Java has a large and active community, which means there are extensive resources, libraries, and frameworks available. Developers can easily find support and solutions to their problems.

3. Scalability: Java is known for its scalability, making it suitable for building large-scale enterprise applications.

## disadvantages:

1. Performance: While the performance of Java has improved over the years, some low-level languages, like C or C++, may still offer better performance for certain types of applications.

2. Startup Time: Java applications may have a longer startup time compared to languages that are compiled to native code.

3. Learning Curve: Java's extensive ecosystem and libraries can make it challenging for beginners to learn the language quickly.

# java components

## java code(.java file)
 â€“ this is the java code you have written, and its saved in the .java file(s)

## javac compiler:
 compile the source code files(.java) into a bytecode so that the jmv will be execute it.Bytecode is saved in a class file by compiler.

 ## Bytecode

 the resulting code after the source code has been executed by the compiler.

 ## Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

the primary function used to execute the bytecode produced by the compiler.

every os has its jvm, the output after execution of bytecode is the same accross all OS, that is why java is platform independent.

## steps to follow when executing a code
1. write a java program in an IDE with exwntion .java

2. the javac compiler is the primary compiler included in the JDK. It takes program as an input and convert it into java bytecode as an output

3. Java Virtual machine- it executes the bytecode generated by the compiler and this phase is called RUN PHASE.
