# intro_to_java
## week 1 day 1
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

## Advantages of Java:
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Java is a pure object-oriented programming language, which promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

2. Strong Community Support: Java has a large and active community, which means there are extensive resources, libraries, and frameworks available. Developers can easily find support and solutions to their problems.

3. Scalability: Java is known for its scalability, making it suitable for building large-scale enterprise applications.

## disadvantages:

1. Performance: While the performance of Java has improved over the years, some low-level languages, like C or C++, may still offer better performance for certain types of applications.

2. Startup Time: Java applications may have a longer startup time compared to languages that are compiled to native code.

3. Learning Curve: Java's extensive ecosystem and libraries can make it challenging for beginners to learn the language quickly.

# java components

## java code(.java file)
 – this is the java code you have written, and its saved in the .java file(s)

## javac compiler:
 compile the source code files(.java) into a bytecode so that the jmv will be execute it.Bytecode is saved in a class file by compiler.

 ## Bytecode

 the resulting code after the source code has been executed by the compiler.

 ## Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

the primary function used to execute the bytecode produced by the compiler.

every os has its jvm, the output after execution of bytecode is the same accross all OS, that is why java is platform independent.

## steps to follow when executing a code
1. write a java program in an IDE with exwntion .java

2. the javac compiler is the primary compiler included in the JDK. It takes program as an input and convert it into java bytecode as an output

3. Java Virtual machine- it executes the bytecode generated by the compiler and this phase is called RUN PHASE.

## jdk 
complete Java development kit that includes JRE, compiler, and some more tools like javaDoc, java Debugger and more.
for you as a programmer you need to have JDK in order to be able to create java programs.

## JRE
 is the runtime environment required for running Java applications. It includes the JVM and other libraries that are needed for running Java programs but not for compiling them.

 # java Main features

 ## Platform Independence (Write Once, Run Anywhere):
 Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which is an intermediate form that can be executed on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Object-Oriented: 
Java is designed around the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It supports concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, making it easy to organize and structure code.

## simple
 Java has a straightforward syntax, and its popularity has led to a large and active developer community. There are plenty of resources, tutorials, and forums available for learning and getting support.

## Robust language

when Java is described as a "robust" programming language, it refers to its ability to provide strong safeguards against errors and its capability to handle unexpected conditions gracefully.

## Security:
 Java has built-in security features, including a robust security model and a bytecode verifier, which helps ensure that code running on the JVM is safe and doesn't violate security constraints

## Multithreading:
 Java supports multithreading, allowing developers to write programs that can perform multiple tasks concurrently

 ## setting up the environment
etting up a Java development environment involves installing the Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Here are the steps to set up a basic Java environment:

1. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK):
## For Windows:
## Download JDK:
Visit the Oracle JDK download page or use an alternative like OpenJDK.

## Install JDK:
Follow the installation instructions provided on the download page.

## Set the PATH variable:
Add the JDK bin directory to your system's PATH variable. This allows you to run Java commands from any command prompt.

## java first program
public class firstProgram {
   public static void main(String[]args){
      System.out.println("hello world");
   }

} 


## First program Explained
public class HelloWorld {-: Every java application must have at least one class definition that consists of class keyword followed by classname. In this case classname is HelloWorld

public static void main (String[]args) {  this line is the main method. lets break the second line of code in our program to 
public : This makes the main method public that means that we can call the method from outside the class.

static : We do not need to create object for static methods to run. They can run itself.

void : It does not return anything.

main: It is the method name. This is the entry point method from which the JVM can run your program.

String [] args: Used for command line arguments that are passed as strings.

System.out println("Hello World"); -: This method prints the contents inside the double quotes into the console and inserts a newline after


# Structure of a java program
 
1. **Package Declaration:**
   Java programs often start with a package declaration. A package is a way to organize related classes. It is not mandatory, but it's good practice to include it. For example:

   ```java
   package com.example.myprogram;
   ```

2. **Import Statements:**
   After the package declaration, you may have import statements. These statements allow you to use classes from other packages without having to use their fully qualified names. For example:

   ```java
   import java.util.Scanner;
   ```

3. **Class Declaration:**
   A Java program must have at least one class, and the main class should have a `main` method where the program execution begins. The class name should match the filename (excluding the .java extension). For example:

   ```java
   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // Program logic goes here
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Comments:**
   Comments are used to explain the code and are not executed by the compiler. They can be single-line (`//`) or multi-line (`/* */`). For example:

   ```java
   // This is a single-line comment

   /*
   This is a multi-line comment.
   It can span multiple lines.
   */
   ```

5. **Variables:**
   Declare variables to store data. Java is statically typed, so you need to specify the data type of each variable. For example:

   ```java
   int age = 25;
   String name = "John";
   ```

6. **Methods:**
   Methods are blocks of code that perform a specific task. The `main` method is the entry point of a Java program, and other methods are defined as needed. For example:

   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       // Program logic goes here
   }

   public static int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

7. **Control Flow Statements:**
   Use control flow statements like `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, etc., to control the flow of execution in your program. For example:

   ```java
   if (condition) {
       // Code to execute if the condition is true
   } else {
       // Code to execute if the condition is false
   }

   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       // Code to repeat multiple times
   }
   ```

8. **Object-Oriented Features:**
   Java is an object-oriented programming language, and programs often involve creating classes and objects. You might use concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

9. **Exception Handling:**
   Java provides exception handling with `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw` statements to deal with runtime errors. For example:

   ```java
   try {
       // Code that might throw an exception
   } catch (Exception e) {
       // Code to handle the exception
   } finally {
       // Code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not
   }
   ```

10. **Documentation:**
    It's a good practice to include documentation for your classes and methods using JavaDoc comments. For example:

    ```java
    /**
     * This is a JavaDoc comment for the MyClass class.
     */
    public class MyClass {
        /**
         * This is a JavaDoc comment for the myMethod method.
         * @param param1 Description of parameter 1
         * @param param2 Description of parameter 2
         * @return Description of the return value
         */
        public int myMethod(int param1, int param2) {
            // Method logic goes here
        }
    }
    ```

Remember, this is a basic structure, and the actual structure can vary based on the complexity and purpose of the program. It's also common to organize code into multiple classes and packages for larger projects.

What is a variable? 

A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. 

The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution. 

A variable is only a name given to a memory location; all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location. 

In Java, all the variables must be declared before use. 

How to declare variables? 

type: Type of data that can be stored in this variable. 

name: Name given to the variable. 

It can be assigned values in two ways: 

Variable Initialization 

Assigning value by taking input. 

 

Declaring and initialize variables: 

datatype: Type of data that can be stored in this variable. 

variable_name: Name given to the variable. 

value: It is the initial value stored in the variable. 

Declaring variables examples 

float simpleInterest; - Declaring float variable 

int myAge = 19; - Declaring and Initializing integer variable 

char firstLetter = 'h'; - Declaring and Initializing character variable 

 

 

There are three types of variables in Java: 

 

Local Variables: A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called local variable. 

Instance Variables: Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor or block. 

Static Variables: Static variables are also known as Class variables. 

 

Data types in Java: 

1) Primitive data types - A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods. 

2)  Non-primitive data types – Arrays and Strings are non-primitive data types, these are the datatypes which have instances like objects. Hence, they are called reference variables. They are primarily classes, arrays, strings or interfaces. 

 

There are eight primitive data types in Java: 

Byte 

Short 

Int 

Long 

Float 

Double 

Boolean 

Char 

# day 3 OOP

what is OOP?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, and it is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects." Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language, and it embodies the principles of OOP.

Key Concepts in Java OOP:
Class:

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.
Object:

An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the class blueprint and represents a specific entity in the program.
Method:

A method is a function defined within a class. It represents the behavior or actions that objects of the class can perform.
Instance Variable:

An instance variable is a variable defined in a class and represents the state or properties of an object.
Constructor:

A constructor is a special method used for initializing objects when they are created. It has the same name as the class and is called automatically when an object is instantiated.
Java's support for OOP allows for the creation of modular, reusable, and maintainable code. The use of classes and objects facilitates the modeling of real-world entities and their interactions, making it easier to manage and understand complex systems.

# activity 1
Object-oriented programming (OOP) has become more popular than declarative and procedural programming for several reasons, and its popularity can be attributed to the following advantages:

Modularity and Reusability:

OOP promotes the concept of encapsulation, allowing the bundling of data and methods into a single unit (class). This leads to modular code, where each class represents a self-contained module with well-defined interfaces. This modularity facilitates code organization and makes it easier to reuse and maintain code components.
Code Reusability:

Inheritance in OOP allows for the creation of new classes that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy. Developers can extend existing classes to create new ones without rewriting the entire code.
Abstraction:

OOP provides abstraction, allowing developers to focus on the essential properties and behaviors of objects while hiding unnecessary details. Abstract classes and interfaces enable the creation of high-level, generalized blueprints that can be extended to create more specific implementations.
Encapsulation:

Encapsulation encapsulates the implementation details within a class, exposing only necessary interfaces to the outside world. This reduces the complexity of the code, improves maintainability, and minimizes the risk of unintended interference with the internal workings of a class.

Flexibility and Extensibility:

OOP languages support polymorphism, allowing objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. This flexibility enables the development of generic and extensible code, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements.
Modeling Real-World Concepts:

OOP is well-suited for modeling and simulating real-world entities and their relationships. Concepts like objects, classes, and inheritance closely align with how we think about and categorize things in the real world. This makes OOP a natural choice for applications where the goal is to model and represent complex systems.
Collaborative Development:

OOP encourages the creation of well-defined interfaces and contracts between different parts of a program. This helps in collaborative development, where teams can work on different parts of a system independently as long as they adhere to the specified interfaces.
Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development:

OOP is often the preferred paradigm for developing graphical user interfaces. The concept of objects representing visual elements and their interactions aligns well with GUI design principles.

# Features of OOP – Core features

1.Encapsulation
2. polymorphism
3. inheritance
4. abstraction

### Encapsulation:
Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects, and it encapsulates the internal details of how an object works.

### Polymorphism:
Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding). Polymorphism makes it possible to write more generic and reusable code.

### Inheritance:

Inheritance allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy of classes, where a subclass can extend or override the functionality of its superclass.

### Abstraction:
Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors relevant to the problem. It allows programmers to focus on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality. Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in Java.

# activity 2
Here are the three Java classes based on the provided information:

1. **PurchaseItem Class:**
   ```java
   public class PurchaseItem {
       private String name;
       private double unitPrice;

       // Constructor to initialize instance variables
       public PurchaseItem(String name, double unitPrice) {
           this.name = name;
           this.unitPrice = unitPrice;
       }

       // Default constructor
       public PurchaseItem() {
           this.name = "no item";
           this.unitPrice = 0;
       }

       // Method to get the unit price
       public double getPrice() {
           return unitPrice;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **WeighedItem Class (Subclass of PurchaseItem):**
   ```java
   public class WeighedItem extends PurchaseItem {
       private double weight;

       // Constructor using superclass constructor
       public WeighedItem(String name, double unitPrice, double weight) {
           super(name, unitPrice);
           this.weight = weight;
       }

       // Override getPrice method
       @Override
       public double getPrice() {
           // Calculate the price based on unit price and weight
           return super.getPrice() * weight;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **CountedItem Class (Subclass of PurchaseItem):**
   ```java
   public class CountedItem extends PurchaseItem {
       private int quantity;

       // Constructor using superclass constructor
       public CountedItem(String name, double unitPrice, int quantity) {
           super(name, unitPrice);
           this.quantity = quantity;
       }

       // Override getPrice method
       @Override
       public double getPrice() {
           // Calculate the price based on unit price and quantity
           return super.getPrice() * quantity;
       }
   }
   ```

Example of using these classes:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example of WeighedItem
        WeighedItem banana = new WeighedItem("Banana", 3.00, 1.37);
        System.out.println(banana.getName() + " @ " + banana.getPrice() + " R" + banana.getPrice());

        // Example of CountedItem
        CountedItem pens = new CountedItem("Pens", 4.5, 10);
        System.out.println(pens.getName() + " @ " + pens.getPrice() + " R" + pens.getPrice());
    }
}
```

In this example, the `WeighedItem` and `CountedItem` classes extend the `PurchaseItem` class. The `getPrice` method is overridden in each subclass to calculate the total price based on the specific properties of that item (weight or quantity). The `super.getPrice()` call is used to access the `getPrice` method of the superclass.

# Features of OOP – Other features

 coupling, cohesion, association, aggregation, and composition—additional concepts related to object-oriented design and programming.

1. **Coupling:**
   - **Definition:** Coupling refers to the degree of dependence between classes or modules. It measures how much one class knows about another. Low coupling is desirable as it leads to more maintainable and flexible systems.
   - **Types:**
     - **Low Coupling:** Classes have minimal knowledge of each other. Changes in one class have minimal impact on others.
     - **High Coupling:** Classes are closely connected, and changes in one class may require changes in others.

2. **Cohesion:**
   - **Definition:** Cohesion measures how closely the elements within a module (class or method) are related to each other. High cohesion is desirable as it leads to more maintainable and understandable code.
   - **Types:**
     - **High Cohesion:** Elements within a module are closely related and work together to achieve a common goal.
     - **Low Cohesion:** Elements within a module have weak relationships and may not contribute to a common goal.

3. **Association:**
   - **Definition:** Association represents a bi-directional relationship between two classes. It can be a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship.
   - **Example:** In a university system, a `Student` class may be associated with a `Course` class through enrollment.

4. **Aggregation:**
   - **Definition:** Aggregation is a special form of association representing a "whole-part" relationship between classes. It implies that one class (the whole) contains another class (the part), but the part can exist independently.
   - **Example:** In a car example, a `Car` class may have an aggregation relationship with a `Wheel` class. A `Car` has wheels, and wheels can exist independently.

5. **Composition:**
   - **Definition:** Composition is a stronger form of aggregation, where the part cannot exist independently of the whole. If the whole is destroyed, all its parts are destroyed as well.
   - **Example:** In a computer example, a `Computer` class may have a composition relationship with a `CPU` class. If the `Computer` is destroyed, the `CPU` is also destroyed.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing systems with maintainability, flexibility, and clarity in mind. Properly managing coupling and cohesion helps create systems that are easier to modify and extend. Meanwhile, understanding association, aggregation, and composition allows for modeling real-world relationships more accurately in your code.

## activity 3
Certainly! Below are three Java classes, `Company`, `Store`, and `Product`, demonstrating the relationships using association and aggregation:

1. **Product Class:**
   ```java
   public class Product {
       private String name;
       private int quantity;
       private double price;

       // Constructor
       public Product(String name, int quantity, double price) {
           this.name = name;
           this.quantity = quantity;
           this.price = price;
       }

       // Getters and Setters (not shown for brevity)
   }
   ```

2. **Store Class (Aggregation with Product):**
   ```java
   import java.util.ArrayList;
   import java.util.List;

   public class Store {
       private String name;
       private String location;
       private List<Product> productList;

       // Constructor
       public Store(String name, String location) {
           this.name = name;
           this.location = location;
           this.productList = new ArrayList<>();
       }

       // Aggregation: Adding a Product to the ProductList
       public void addProduct(Product product) {
           productList.add(product);
       }

       // Getters and Setters (not shown for brevity)
   }
   ```

3. **Company Class (Association with Store):**
   ```java
   import java.util.ArrayList;
   import java.util.List;

   public class Company {
       private String name;
       private List<Store> storeList;

       // Constructor
       public Company(String name) {
           this.name = name;
           this.storeList = new ArrayList<>();
       }

       // Association: Adding a Store to the StoreList
       public void addStore(Store store) {
           storeList.add(store);
       }

       // Getters and Setters (not shown for brevity)
   }
   ```

In the above demo:

- The `Product` class represents a product with attributes such as name, quantity, and price.
- The `Store` class represents a store with attributes like name, location, and a list of products. The relationship with `Product` is aggregation, as a store contains products, and products can exist independently.
- The `Company` class represents a company with a name and a list of stores. The relationship with `Store` is association, as a company is associated with multiple stores.
