# intro_to_java
## week 1 day 1
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

## Advantages of Java:
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Java is a pure object-oriented programming language, which promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

2. Strong Community Support: Java has a large and active community, which means there are extensive resources, libraries, and frameworks available. Developers can easily find support and solutions to their problems.

3. Scalability: Java is known for its scalability, making it suitable for building large-scale enterprise applications.

## disadvantages:

1. Performance: While the performance of Java has improved over the years, some low-level languages, like C or C++, may still offer better performance for certain types of applications.

2. Startup Time: Java applications may have a longer startup time compared to languages that are compiled to native code.

3. Learning Curve: Java's extensive ecosystem and libraries can make it challenging for beginners to learn the language quickly.

# java components

## java code(.java file)
 â€“ this is the java code you have written, and its saved in the .java file(s)

## javac compiler:
 compile the source code files(.java) into a bytecode so that the jmv will be execute it.Bytecode is saved in a class file by compiler.

 ## Bytecode

 the resulting code after the source code has been executed by the compiler.

 ## Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

the primary function used to execute the bytecode produced by the compiler.

every os has its jvm, the output after execution of bytecode is the same accross all OS, that is why java is platform independent.

## steps to follow when executing a code
1. write a java program in an IDE with exwntion .java

2. the javac compiler is the primary compiler included in the JDK. It takes program as an input and convert it into java bytecode as an output

3. Java Virtual machine- it executes the bytecode generated by the compiler and this phase is called RUN PHASE.

## jdk 
complete Java development kit that includes JRE, compiler, and some more tools like javaDoc, java Debugger and more.
for you as a programmer you need to have JDK in order to be able to create java programs.

## JRE
 is the runtime environment required for running Java applications. It includes the JVM and other libraries that are needed for running Java programs but not for compiling them.

 # java Main features

 ## Platform Independence (Write Once, Run Anywhere):
 Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which is an intermediate form that can be executed on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Object-Oriented: 
Java is designed around the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It supports concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, making it easy to organize and structure code.

## simple
 Java has a straightforward syntax, and its popularity has led to a large and active developer community. There are plenty of resources, tutorials, and forums available for learning and getting support.

## Robust language

when Java is described as a "robust" programming language, it refers to its ability to provide strong safeguards against errors and its capability to handle unexpected conditions gracefully.

## Security:
 Java has built-in security features, including a robust security model and a bytecode verifier, which helps ensure that code running on the JVM is safe and doesn't violate security constraints

## Multithreading:
 Java supports multithreading, allowing developers to write programs that can perform multiple tasks concurrently

 ## setting up the environment
etting up a Java development environment involves installing the Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Here are the steps to set up a basic Java environment:

1. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK):
## For Windows:
## Download JDK:
Visit the Oracle JDK download page or use an alternative like OpenJDK.

## Install JDK:
Follow the installation instructions provided on the download page.

## Set the PATH variable:
Add the JDK bin directory to your system's PATH variable. This allows you to run Java commands from any command prompt.

## java first program
public class firstProgram {
   public static void main(String[]args){
      System.out.println("hello world");
   }

} 


## First program Explained
public class HelloWorld {-: Every java application must have at least one class definition that consists of class keyword followed by classname. In this case classname is HelloWorld

public static void main (String[]args) {  this line is the main method. lets break the second line of code in our program to 
public : This makes the main method public that means that we can call the method from outside the class.

static : We do not need to create object for static methods to run. They can run itself.

void : It does not return anything.

main: It is the method name. This is the entry point method from which the JVM can run your program.

String [] args: Used for command line arguments that are passed as strings.

System.out println("Hello World"); -: This method prints the contents inside the double quotes into the console and inserts a newline after


# Structure of a java program
 
1. **Package Declaration:**
   Java programs often start with a package declaration. A package is a way to organize related classes. It is not mandatory, but it's good practice to include it. For example:

   ```java
   package com.example.myprogram;
   ```

2. **Import Statements:**
   After the package declaration, you may have import statements. These statements allow you to use classes from other packages without having to use their fully qualified names. For example:

   ```java
   import java.util.Scanner;
   ```

3. **Class Declaration:**
   A Java program must have at least one class, and the main class should have a `main` method where the program execution begins. The class name should match the filename (excluding the .java extension). For example:

   ```java
   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // Program logic goes here
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Comments:**
   Comments are used to explain the code and are not executed by the compiler. They can be single-line (`//`) or multi-line (`/* */`). For example:

   ```java
   // This is a single-line comment

   /*
   This is a multi-line comment.
   It can span multiple lines.
   */
   ```

5. **Variables:**
   Declare variables to store data. Java is statically typed, so you need to specify the data type of each variable. For example:

   ```java
   int age = 25;
   String name = "John";
   ```

6. **Methods:**
   Methods are blocks of code that perform a specific task. The `main` method is the entry point of a Java program, and other methods are defined as needed. For example:

   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       // Program logic goes here
   }

   public static int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

7. **Control Flow Statements:**
   Use control flow statements like `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, etc., to control the flow of execution in your program. For example:

   ```java
   if (condition) {
       // Code to execute if the condition is true
   } else {
       // Code to execute if the condition is false
   }

   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       // Code to repeat multiple times
   }
   ```

8. **Object-Oriented Features:**
   Java is an object-oriented programming language, and programs often involve creating classes and objects. You might use concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

9. **Exception Handling:**
   Java provides exception handling with `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw` statements to deal with runtime errors. For example:

   ```java
   try {
       // Code that might throw an exception
   } catch (Exception e) {
       // Code to handle the exception
   } finally {
       // Code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not
   }
   ```

10. **Documentation:**
    It's a good practice to include documentation for your classes and methods using JavaDoc comments. For example:

    ```java
    /**
     * This is a JavaDoc comment for the MyClass class.
     */
    public class MyClass {
        /**
         * This is a JavaDoc comment for the myMethod method.
         * @param param1 Description of parameter 1
         * @param param2 Description of parameter 2
         * @return Description of the return value
         */
        public int myMethod(int param1, int param2) {
            // Method logic goes here
        }
    }
    ```

Remember, this is a basic structure, and the actual structure can vary based on the complexity and purpose of the program. It's also common to organize code into multiple classes and packages for larger projects.
